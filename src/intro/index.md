Most data scientists have taught themselves most of what they know about programming.
As a result,
many have gaps in their knowledge:
they may be experts in some areas,
but don't even know what they don't know about others.

One of those other areas is software design.
A large program is not just a dozen short programs stacked on top of each other;
since *N* things can interact with each other in *N(N-1)/2* ways,
doubling the size of a program more than doubles its complexity
unless we reorganize its parts
([%f intro-complexity %]).
Since our brains can only hold a small number of things at once [%b Hermans2021 %],
making large programs comprehensible, testable, shareable, and maintainable
requires more than using functions and sensible variable names:
it requires design.

%]

The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples [%b Schon1984 Petre2016 %].
These lessons therefore build small versions of tools that programmers use every day
to show how experienced software designers think.
Along the way,
they introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science
that most data scientists haven't encountered.
Finally,
we hope that if you know how programming tools work,
you'll be more likely to use them
and better able to use them well.

## Who is this book for? {: #intro-audience}

This [learner persona][t3_personas] [%b Wilson2019 %] describes who this book is for:

> Maya has a master's degree in genomics.
> She knows enough Python to analyze data from her experiments,
> but is struggling to write code that other people (including her future self) can use.
> These lessons will teach her how to design, build, and test large programs
> in less time and with less pain.

Like Maya, you should be able to:

-   Write Python programs using lists, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and functions.

-   Puzzle your way through Python programs that use classes and exceptions.

-   Run basic Unix shell commands like `ls` and `mkdir`.

-   Read and write a little bit of HTML.

-   Use [Git][git] to save and share files.
    (It's OK not to know [the more obscure commands][git_man_page_generator].)

This book is also designed to help another persona:

> Yim teaches two college courses on web programming.
> They are frustrated that so many books talk about details but not about design
> and use examples that their students can't relate to.
> This material will give them material they can use in class
> and starting points for course projects.

## What does this book cover? {: #intro-contents}

Programmers have invented [a lot of tools][programming_tools] over the years.
This book focuses on those that people use while building code,
but includes a few like databases and web servers
that are primarily used in building general-purpose applications.

[%x glossary %] defines the terms these lessons introduce,
which in turn define this book's big ideas [%f intro-syllabus %]:

-   Source code is just text.

-   A program in memory is just a data structure.

-   We can control and inspect programs while they are running.

-   A week of hard work can sometimes save us an hour of thought.

## How is this book formatted? {: #intro-layout}

We display Python source code like this:

[% inc file="python_sample.py" %]

and Unix shell commands like this:
{: .continue}

[% inc file="shell_sample.sh" %]

Data files and program output are shown like this:
{: .continue}

[% inc file="data_sample.yml" %]

[% inc file="output_sample.out" %]

We use `...` to show where lines have been omitted,
and occasionally break lines in unnatural ways to make them fit on the page.
Where we do this,
we end all but the last line with a single backslash `\`.
Finally,
we write functions as `function_name` rather than `function_name()`.
The latter is more common,
but people don't use `array_name[]` for arrays,
and the empty parentheses makes it hard to tell
whether we're talking about "the function itself" or "a call to the function with no parameters".
