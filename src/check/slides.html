## The Problem

-   We generate HTML pages to report experiments

-   Want to be sure they have the right structure
    so that people can get information out of them reliably

-   Learning how to do this prepares us for checking code

---

## HTML as Text

-   HTML documents contain [%g tag "tags" %] and text

-   An [%g tag_opening "opening tag" %] like `<p>` starts an element

-   A [%g tag_closing "closing tag" %] like `</p>` ends the element

-   If the element is empty,
    we can use a [%g tag_self_closing "self-closing tag" %] like `<br/>`

-   Opening and self-closing tags can have [%g attribute "attributes" %]

    -   Written as `key="value"` (with some variations)

-   Tags must be properly nested:
    `<a><b></a></b>` is illegal

---

## HTML as a Tree

-   HTML elements form a [%g tree "tree" %] of [%g node "nodes" %] and text

-   The object that represent these make up the [%g dom "Document Object Model" %] (DOM)

## From Text to DOM

-   Real-world HTML is often messy

-   Use [Beautiful Soup][beautiful_soup] to parse it

-   Nodes are `NavigableString` (for text) or `Tag` (for element)

-   `Tag` nodes have properties `name` and `children`

[% inc file="parse.py" keep="main" %]

---

## From Text to DOM

[% inc file="parse.py" keep="text" %]
[% inc file="parse.out" %]

---

## Recursion

[% inc file="parse.py" keep="recurse" %]

-   Text nodes don't have children

-   `for child in node` loops over children of element nodes

---

## Attributes

-   A dictionary `node.attrs`

-   Can be single-valued or multi-valued

[% inc file="attrs.py" keep="recurse" %]

---

## Attributes

[% inc file="attrs.py" keep="text" %]
[% inc file="attrs.out" %]

---

## Build a Catalog

-   What kinds of children do elements have?

    -   `<tr>` (table data) should only appear inside `<table>` or `<tbody>`

-   Recurse through DOM tree

[% inc file="contains.py" keep="recurse" %]

---

## Build a Catalog

[% inc file="page.html" %]

---

## Build a Catalog

[% inc file="contains.out" %]

---

## The Visitor Pattern

-   A [%g visitor_pattern "visitor" %] is a class
    that knows how to get to each element of a data structure

-   Derive a class of our own that does something for those elements

-   When we recurse, allow separate handlers for entry and exit

    -   Useful for things like pretty-printers

---

## The Visitor Pattern

[% inc file="visitor.py" keep="visitor" %]

-   `pass` rather than `NotImplementedError`
    because many uses won't need all these methods

---

## Catalog Reimplemented

[% inc file="catalog.py" keep="visitor" %]

-   Only a few lines shorter than the original

-   But the more complicated the data structure is,
    the more helpful the Visitor pattern becomes

---

## Catalog Reimplemented

[% inc file="catalog.py" keep="main" %]

---

## Visitor in Action

%]

---

## Find Style Violations

-   Compare each parent-child combination against a [%g manifest "manifest" %]

[% inc file="manifest.yml" %]

---

## Find Style Violations

[% inc file="check.py" keep="check" %]

---

## Running the Checker

[% inc file="check.py" keep="main" %]

---

## Results

[% inc file="check.out" %]

-   Because content is supposed to be inside a `section` tag,
    not directly in `body`

-   And we're not supposed to *emphasize* words in lists
