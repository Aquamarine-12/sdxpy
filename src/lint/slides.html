## The Problem

-   Want to check that our code follows style rules

-   And doesn't do things that are likely to be bugs

-   Build a [%g linter "linters" %]

    -   Checks for "fluff" in code

---

## Programs as Trees

-   [%x check %] represented HTML as a [%g dom "DOM tree" %]

-   We can represent code as an [%g abstract_syntax_tree "abstract syntax tree" %] (AST)

-   Each node represents a syntactic element in the program

---

## Programs as Trees

[% inc file="simple.py" %]

[% figure
   slug="lint-ast-simple"
   img="ast_simple.svg"
   alt="Simple AST"
   caption="The abstract syntax tree for a simple Python program."
%]

---

## Building Trees

[% inc file="dump_ast.py" %]
[% inc file="dump_ast_simple.out" head="10" %]

---

## Finding Things

-   Could walk the tree to find `FunctionDef` nodes and record their `name` properties

-   But each node has a different structure,
    so we would have to write a recursive function for each type of node

-   [`ast`][py_ast] module's `ast.NodeVisitor` implements
    the [%g visitor_pattern "Visitor" %] pattern

-   Each time it reaches a node of type `Thing`, it looks for a method `visit_Thing`

---

## Collecting Names

[% inc file="walk_ast.py" keep="class" %]

---

## Collecting Names

1.  `CollectNames` constructors invokes `NodeVisitor` constructor
    before doing anything else

1.  `visit_Assign` and `visit_FunctionDef` must call `self.generic_visit(node)` explicitly
    to recurse

1.  `position` methods uses the fact that every AST node remembers where it came from

---

## Collecting Names

[% inc file="walk_ast.py" keep="main" %]
[% inc pat="walk_ast.*" fill="sh out" %]

---

## What Does This Do?

[% inc file="has_duplicate_keys.py" %]

1.  An error
2.  Keeps the first
3.  Keeps the last
4.  Concatenates

[% inc file="has_duplicate_keys.out" %]

---

## Finding Duplicate Keys

[% inc file="find_duplicate_keys.py" keep="class" %]
[% inc file="find_duplicate_keys.out" %]

---

## False Negatives

-   Our duplicate finder only detects constants

[% inc file="function_keys.py" %]

-   Fundamental theoretical result in computer science is that
    it's impossible to build a general-purpose algorithm
    that predicts the output of a program

---

## Finding Unused Variables

-   Not wrong, but clutter makes code harder to read

-   Have to take [%g scope "scope" %] into account

-   So keep a stack of scopes

[% inc file="find_unused_variables.py" keep="class" %]

---

## Recording Scope

-   Use `namedtuple` from Python's standard library

[% inc file="find_unused_variables.py" keep="scope" %]

---

## Bucketing

-   If the variable's value is being read,
    `node.ctx` (short for "context") is an instance of `Load`

-   If the variable is being written to,
    `node.ctx` is an instance of `Store`

[% inc file="find_unused_variables.py" keep="name" %]

---

## And Finallyâ€¦

[% inc file="find_unused_variables.py" keep="search" %]

---

## Extension

-   Tedious to write a new visitor for each rule

    -   And inefficient

-   Multiple inheritance is the wrong tool for this

    -   What if several people write `visit_FuncDef`?

-   Use [%g method_injection "method injection" %]
    to add methods to classes after they have been defined

---

## Filling In

[% inc file="injection.py" keep="attach" %]

-   A class is just a specialized dictionary (kind of)

---

## Filling In

[% inc file="injection.py" keep="main" %]

-   But still have the problem of [%g name_collision "name collision" %]

---

## Registration

-   Add handlers to a set of lists

[% inc file="register.py" keep="class" %]

---

## Here's How It Works

[% inc file="register.py" keep="handler" %]

[% inc file="register.py" keep="main" %]
