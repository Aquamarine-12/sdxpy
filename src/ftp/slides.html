## The Problem

-   We want to make information available to others

    -   Which includes programs as well as people

-   Understanding how a web server works will help us do this

---

## TCP/IP

-   Most networked computers use [%g internet_protocol "Internet Protocol (IP)" %]

-   Defines multiple layers on top of each other

-   [%g tcp "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP)" %]
    makes communication between computers look like
    reading and writing files

---

## Sockets

-   A [%g socket "sockets" %] is one end of a point-to-point communication channel

-   [%g ip_address "IP address" %] identifies machine

    -   Typically written as four 8-bit numbers like `93.184.216.34`

-   [%g port "port" %] identifies a specific connection on that machine

    -   A number in the range 0â€“65535

    -   Some numbers reserved for well-known applications

    -   E.g., port 80 is usually a web server

## Naming Things

-   IP addresses are hard to remember

    -   And might actually identify a set of machines

-   [%g dns "Domain Name System (DNS)" %] translates names like `third-bit.com`
    into numerical identifiers

---

## Clients and Servers

-   A [%g client "client" %] sends requests and processes responses
    (e.g., web browser)

-   A [%g server "server" %] waits for requests and replies to them
    (e.g., a web server)
