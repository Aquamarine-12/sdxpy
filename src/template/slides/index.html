## The Problem

-   Most pages on a site share some content

-   Many pages want to be customized based on data

-   So many sites use a templating system

    -   Turn data and HTML page with embedded directives into final page

---

## Design Options

1.  Embed commands in an existing language like [EJS][ejs]

2.  Create a mini-language with its own commands like [Jekyll][jekyll]

3.  Put directives in specially-named attributes in the HTML

[% figure
   slide=True
   slug="design-options"
   img="../design_options.svg"
   alt="Three options for page templates"
   caption="Three different ways to implement page templating."
%]

-   We will use the third option so that we don't have to write a parser

## What Does Done Look Like?

[% inc file="../loop.ht" %]

-   `z-loop`: repeat this

-   `z-num`: a constant number

-   `z-var`: fill in a variable

-   `z-if`: conditional

## What Does Done Look Like?

[% inc file="../loop.out" %]
