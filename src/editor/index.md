-   MVC with simple line drawing
    -   `model_original.py` stores lines and current cursor Y position (we'll add X later)
    -   `view_original.py` displays lines in a window
        -   caller's job to make sure number of lines isn't larger than window
        -   if fewer lines, fill bottom with blanks
    -   `controller_original.y` handles interactions
        -   constrain cursor movement
        - select which lines from model to display and ask view to display them
          -   all lines fit in window, so always show them all
          -   cursor near bottom of file, so show last N lines
          -   show slice from cursor down
        - means the slice starts scrolling down as soon as the cursor moves,
          which isn't how most editors work,
          but it's a start
-   `curses_wrapper.py` shows how to initialize curses using wrapper
-   then show lines using `curses`
    -   model and controller stay the same for now
    -   `view_show_lines.py` shows lines
    -   `main_show_lines.py`creates and connects objects and does initialization and finalization
-   now motion
    -   `main_up_down.py`, `controller_up_down.py`, and `view_up_down.py`
    -   event loop
    -   But it leaves characters on screen
    -   So `main_up_down_fixed.py` and `view_up_down_fixed.py`
-   slice: `main_slice.py` (to get parameters) and `view_slice.py`
    -   Benefit of MVC: change parts independently
-   cursor: `main_cursor.py` with `controller_cursor.py` and `view_cursor.py`
    -   show the position of the cursor
    -   but now our scrolling and cursor positioning are biting us
-   viewport wraps the model
    -   `viewport_viewport.py`
    -   `test_viewport.py` to test that the viewport works
    -   then `controller_viewport.py` (much simpler)
    -   and `main_viewport.py` to bind it all together
-   finally the editing
    -   insert digit at the start of the current line
    -   don't move the cursor right
    -   design decision: have the controller modify the model directly or go through viewport?
    -   decide to do the latter, but the former is common
