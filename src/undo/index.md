-   Bring over viewer app
    -   `Window`, `Cursor`, `Buffer`, `App`
    -   Add call to `._add_log` to `App._interact` (another unanticipated hook)

-   Create headless versions
    -   `HeadlessScreen` replaces the `curses` screen
        -   Takes keystrokes as input (what we're simulating)
        -   Automatically generate Ctrl-X when out of keystrokes
        -   Store current state of display in rectangular grid
	-   Would make more sense for `App` to have a method that gets keys
    -   `HeadlessWindow` requires a size
        -   Violates Liskov Substitution Principle
    -   `HeadlessApp` fills in logging methods
    -   First tests make sure we can move around
