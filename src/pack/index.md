-   Software packages often have multiple versions, which are usually identified by multi-part semantic version numbers.
-   A package manager must find a mutually-compatible set of dependencies in order to install a package.
-   Finding a compatible set of packages is equivalent to searching a multi-dimensional space.
-   The work required to find a compatible set of packages can grow exponentially with the number of packages.
-   Eliminating partially-formed combinations of packages can reduce the work required to find a compatible set.
-   An automated theorem prover can determine if a set of logical propositions can be made consistent with each other.
-   Most package managers use some kind of theorem prover to find compatible sets of packages to install.
