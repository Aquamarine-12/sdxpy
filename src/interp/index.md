## Exercises {: #interp-exercises}

### Arrays {: .exercise}

Implement fixed-size one-dimensional arrays:

1.  `["array", 10]` creates an array of 10 elements.
2.  Other instructions that you design get and set array elements by index.

### While Loops {: .exercise}

Implement a `while` loop instruction.
Your implemetation can use either a Python `while` loop or recursion.

### For Loops {: .exercise}

Implement a `for` loop instruction that repeats instructions a certain number of times.
Your implementation should allow users to specify a loop variable
so that they know which iteration of the loop they're in.
