## FAQ {: #syllabus-faq}

Why don't the examples connect with each other? For example, why don't they build toward a complete minimal IDE?
:   It was tempting, but my attempts to do this in the past have never gone well.
    First, it makes maintenance much more difficult
    because a change in an early chapter may have knock-on effects on several subsequent chapters.
    Second, it constraints what is taught and in what order:
    if the examples are independent of each other,
    instructors can pick and choose the pieces that are most relevant to their audience and goals.
