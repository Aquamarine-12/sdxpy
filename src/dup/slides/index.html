## Overview

-   We want to find duplicate files

-   Can't rely on their names

-   Comparing pairs of files byte by byte is slow

    -   And gets slower as the number of files grows

-   So calculate a [%g hash_code "hash code" %] for each file and group files with the same hash code

-   Hashing is a powerful general-purpose technique in software design
