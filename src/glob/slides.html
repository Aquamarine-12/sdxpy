## The Problem

-   `glob.glob` finds files whose names match patterns

-   `2023-*.{pdf,txt}` matches `2023-01.txt` and `2023-final.pdf`
    but not `draft-2023.docx`

   img="examples.svg"
   alt="Matching examples"
   caption="Examples of glob matching."
%]

-   How does this work?

## Write a Few Tests

| Pattern | Text     | Match? || Pattern | Text     | Match? |
| ------- | -------- | ------ || ------- | -------- | ------ |
| abc     | "abc"    | True   || a*c     | "abc"    | True   |
| ab      | "abc"    | False  || {a,b}   | "a"      | True   |
| abc     | "ab"     | False  || {a,b}   | "c"      | False  |
| *       | ""       | True   || {a,b}   | "ab"     | False  |
| *       | "abc"    | True   || *{x,y}  | "abcx"   | True   |

## Objects vs. Functions

-   Create things to match particular cases instead of One Big Function

-   Some of those things need to carry data around

    -   E.g., matching specific literal characters

-   So create objects

---

## Design Patterns

-   Use the [%g chain_of_responsibility_pattern "Chain of Responsibility" %] pattern

    -   Each object matches if it can…

    -   …then asks something else to try to match the rest of the text

[% figure
   slug="glob-chain"
   img="chain.svg"
   alt="Chain of Responsibility"
   caption="Matching with Chain of Responsibility."
%]

---

## Matching a Literal String

[% inc file="glob_lit.py" %]

-   `chars` is the characters to be matched
-   `rest` is responsible for matching the rest of the text
    -   May be `None`
-   `start` is needed when this isn't the first matcher

---

## Testing the Matcher

[% inc file="test_glob_lit.py" keep="tests" %]

-   Give tests long names instead of using comments
    -   So that failure reports are immediately readable

---

## Does Chaining Work?

[% inc file="test_glob_lit.py" keep="chain" %]

--

-   Yup

---

## Wildcards

-   `*` can match zero or more characters

[% inc file="glob_any.py" %]

---

## And We Test It


[% inc file="test_glob_any.py" keep="tests" %]

---

## Matching Alternatives

[% inc file="glob_either.py" %]

---

## And We Test It

[% inc file="test_glob_either.py" keep="tests" %]

---

## But Wait…

[% inc file="test_glob_problem.py" keep="keep" %]
[% inc file="test_glob_problem.out" %]

-   `Either` doesn't handle `rest`

---

## Rethinking

-   We now have three matchers with the same interfaces
    -   Use the [%g extract_parent_class_refactoring "Extract Parent Class" %] [%g refactor "refactoring" %]
-   `if self.rest is None` all over the place
    -   Use the [%g null_object_pattern "Null Object" %] pattern instead

## We Didn't Invent This

</div>

---

## The Parent Class

[% inc file="glob_null.py" keep="parent" %]

-   Assume every child class has a `_match` method

-   This method returns the location to continue searching

-   So `Match.match` checks that we've reached the end of the text

---

## The Null Object Class

[% inc file="glob_null.py" keep="null" %]

-   Must be the last one in the chain

-   Doesn't advance the match (i.e., does nothing)

---

## Refactoring Literal Matcher

[% inc file="glob_null.py" keep="lit" %]

-   Parent class initializes data that it defines
    -   Yes, the `Null` class broke this rule…
-   Return `None` for "no match" or whatever `self.rest` returns
    -   If this object's `rest` is `Null`,
        this will be the index after our match

---

## Refactoring Wildcard

[% inc file="glob_null.py" keep="any" %]

-   The exercises will ask, "Why `len(text) + 1`?"

---

## Refactoring Alternatives

[% inc file="glob_null.py" keep="either" %]

-   Could easily be extended to any number of alternatives

---

## Testing

-   None of the existing tests change
    -   None of the constructors changed
    -   Neither did the signature of `match`
-   We should (should) add a couple of tests for `Null`
-   But basically we're done
-   And we can easily add matchers for other kinds of patterns
