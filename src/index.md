Most data scientists have taught themselves most of what they know
about programming.  As a result, many have gaps in their knowledge:
they may be experts in some areas, but don't even know what they don't
know about others.

One of those other areas is software design.  A large program is not
just a dozen short programs stacked on top of each other: doubling the
size of a program more than doubles its complexity.  Since our brains
can only hold a small number of things at once, making large programs
comprehensible, testable, shareable, and maintainable requires more
than using functions and sensible variable names: it requires design.

The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples.  These
lessons therefore build small versions of tools that programmers use
every day to show how experienced software designers think.  Along the
way, they introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science that
most data scientists haven't encountered.  Finally, we hope that if
you know how programming tools work, you'll be more likely to use them
and better able to use them well.

## How You Can Help

Everything is welcome, but what would help most is:

1.  Fixes for mistakes in the code, the descriptions, or the formatting.
    All of the examples run and all of the tests pass,
    that doesn't guarantee they're correct.

1.  Reports of continuity errors,
    e.g.,
    places where a concept is used before it is explained.

1.  Suggestions for new diagrams, or for ways to improve existing ones.

1.  New or clearer summary points for each chapter's syllabus.

1.  More or better exercises.
    "This is too hard" or "this is unclear" helps as well.
