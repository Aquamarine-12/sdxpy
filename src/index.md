The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples,
and the most approachable examples are ones that readers are already familiar with.
These lessons therefore build small versions
of tools that programmers use every day
to show how experienced software designers think.
Along the way,
they introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science
that many self-taught programmers haven't encountered.
We hope these lessons will help you design better software yourself,
and that if you know how programming tools work,
you'll be more likely to use them
and better able to use them well.

Help of all kinds is welcomeâ€”we are very grateful for the following:

1.  Fixes for mistakes in the code, the descriptions, or the formatting.
    All of the examples run and all of the tests pass,
    that doesn't guarantee they're correct.

1.  Reports of continuity errors,
    e.g.,
    places where a concept is used before it is explained.

1.  Suggestions for new diagrams, or for ways to improve existing ones.

1.  New or clearer summary points for each chapter's syllabus.

1.  More or better exercises.
    "This is too hard" or "this is unclear" helps as well.
