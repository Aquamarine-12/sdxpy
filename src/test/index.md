## Exercises {: #test-exercises}

### Looping Over `globals` {: .exercise}

What happens if you run:

```python
for name in globals():
    print(name)
```

What happens if you run:

```python
name = None
for name in globals():
    print(name)
```

Why?

### Counting Results {: .exercise}

1.  Modify the test framework so that it reports which tests passed, failed, or had errors
    and also reports a summary of how many tests produced each result.

2.  Write unit tests to check that your answer to partÂ 1 works correctly.

### Setup and Teardown {: .exercise}

Testing frameworks often allow programmers to specify a `setup` function
that is to be run before each test
and a corresponding `teardown` function
that is to be run after each test.
(`setup` usually re-creates complicated test fixtures,
while `teardown` functions are sometimes needed to clean up after tests,
e.g., to close database connections or delete temporary files.)

Modify the testing tool in this chapter so that
if a file of tests contains a function called `setup`
then the tool calls it exactly once before running each test in the file.
Add a similar way to register a `teardown` function.

### Module Names {: .exercise}

Our last test runner generated names `m0`, `m1`, and so on
so that each module would have a unique name.
What happens if we don't do this?
I.e.,
what happens if we use the same constant string for all modules that we load?
