## How to Save Data?

-   Prose as plain text
-   Tables as CSV
-   What about objects?
    -   List of dictionaries of lists of dictionaries

---

## Existing Options

-   [JSON][py_json] or [YAML][py_yaml]: language-neutral
    -   But therefore lowest common denominator
    -   Boolean, number, string, list, dictionary (with string keys)
-   [pickle][py_pickle] module: Python-specific
    -   Arbitrary nested objects (good)
    -   Other languages can't read its files (bad)

---

## And Then There's This Guy

-   What to do with user-defined classes?
    -   Or things from the standard library, for that matter?
-   Convert user types to built-in types
    -   Either the object tells us how…
    -   …or we do it generically
    -   Either way, how to convert back?
-   Save class definitions as well as objects' values
    -   Most general (code is just data)
    -   But most difficult to implement
    -   And a potential security hole

---

## Aliasing

```python
shared = ["shared"]
fixture = [shared, shared]
```

<figure>

</figure>

-   "Surely nobody would ever do this!"
-   But every child node in an HTML tree has a reference to its parent

---

## Getting Started

-   Store each __atomic value__ on a line of its own
    -   `type_name:value`

```
bool:True
int:123
```

-   Split strings on newlines
    -   Save the number of lines

```
# input
this is
two lines
```
```
# output
str:2
this is
two lines
```

---

## Implementation

```python
def save(writer, thing):
    if isinstance(thing, bool):
        print(f"bool:{thing}", file=writer)

    elif isinstance(thing, float):
        print(f"float:{thing}", file=writer)

    elif isinstance(thing, int):
        print(f"int:{thing}", file=writer)

    elif isinstance(thing, str):
        lines = thing.split("\n")
        print(f"str:{len(lines)}", file=writer)
        for line in lines:
            print(line, file=writer)

    …more code to come…
```

---

## Collections

-   Save type and number of elements

```python
def save(writer, thing):
    …previous code…

    elif isinstance(thing, list):
        print(f"list:{len(thing)}", file=writer)
        for item in thing:
            save(writer, item)

    …save a set…

    elif isinstance(thing, dict):
        print(f"dict:{len(thing)}", file=writer)
        for (key, value) in thing.items():
            save(writer, key)
            save(writer, value)

    else:
        raise ValueError(f"unknown type of thing {type(thing)}")
```

---

## What This Looks Like

```python
save([False, 3.14, "hello", {"left": 1, "right": [2, 3]}])
```
```
list:4
bool:False
float:3.14
str:1
hello
dict:2
str:1
left
int:1
str:1
right
list:2
int:2
int:3
```

-   Computer doesn't need indentation or end markers
-   But we might add them for readability

---

## Reading Data

```python
def load(reader):
    line = reader.readline()[:-1]
    assert line, "Nothing to read"
    fields = line.split(":", maxsplit=1)
    assert len(fields) == 2, f"Badly-formed line {line}"
    key, value = fields

    if key == "bool":
        names = {"True": True, "False": False}
        assert value in names, f"Unknown Boolean {value}"
        return names[value]

    elif key == "float":
        return float(value)

    …more code to come…
```

---

## Reading Multi-line Values

```python
```python
def load(reader):
    …previous code…

    elif key == "str":
        return "\n".join([reader.readline()[:-1]
                          for _ in range(int(value))])

    elif key == "list":
        return [load(reader) for _ in range(int(value))]

    …sets and dictionaries…

    else:
        raise ValueError(f"unknown type of thing {line}")
```

---

## Open-Closed Principle

-   Software should be open for extension but closed for modification
    -   I.e., should be able to add new code without rewriting existing code
-   Create a dispatch function that figures out what reader or writer to call
-   Find appropriate things to call dynamically
-   Instead of looking for functions, look for methods
-   If the type of the thing we're saving is `something`,
    provide a method `_something`

---

## Saving

```python
class SaveOop:
    def __init__(self, writer):
        self.writer = writer

    def save(self, thing):
        typename = type(thing).__name__
        method = f"_{typename}"
        assert hasattr(self, method), \
            f"Unknown object type {typename}"
        getattr(self, method)(thing)

    def _bool(self, thing):
        self._write("bool", thing)

    …other methods…

    def _write(self, *fields):
        print(":".join(str(f) for f in fields), file=self.writer)
```

-   Handle loading the same way

---

## Handling Aliases

<figure>
  <img src="../persistence_shared.svg" alt="A shared data structure">
  <figcaption>A shared data structure</figcaption>
</figure>

-   Store a unique ID for every object using Python's `id`
-   Keep track of the objects seen so far
-   Write that ID the first time we see the object
-   Write a special entry when we see the object again

---

## Saving

```python
class SaveAlias(SaveOop):
    def __init__(self, writer):
*        self.seen = set()

    def save(self, thing):
*        thing_id = id(thing)
*        if thing_id in self.seen:
*            self._write("alias", thing_id, "")
*            return

        self.seen.add(thing_id)
        typename = type(thing).__name__
        method = f"_{typename}"
        assert hasattr(self, method), \
            f"Unknown object type {typename}"
        getattr(self, method)(thing)

    def _bool(self, thing):
        self._write("bool", id(thing), thing)
```

---

## What It Looks Like

```python
word = "word"
child = [word, word]
parent = []
parent.append(parent)
parent.append(child)

saver = SaveAlias(sys.stdout)
saver.save(parent)
```
```
list:4353637888:2
alias:4353637888:
list:4353243008:2
str:4353242416:1
word
alias:4353242416:
```

## Strings

Modify the framework so that strings are stored using escape characters like `\n`
instead of being split across several lines.

## A Dangling Colon

Why is there a colon at the end of the line `alias:12345678:`
when we create an alias marker?

## Fallback

1.  Modify `LoadExtend` so that
    if the user didn't provide the class needed to reconstruct some archived data,
    the `load` method returns a simple dictionary instead.
1.  Why is this a bad idea?
