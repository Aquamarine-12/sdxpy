## Why Binary?

-   Bits take less space
    -   `"10239472"` is 8 bytes, but `10239472` is just 4
-   Operations are much faster
-   Hardware gives us bits
-   How would we represent images, audio, or video as characters?

```
                      _. - ~ ~ ~ - .
   ..       __.    .-~               ~-.
   ((\     /   `}.~                     `.
    \\\   {     }               /     \   \
(\   \\~~^      }              |       }   \
 \`.-~ -@~      }  ,-.         |       )    \
 (___     ) _}   (    :        |    / /      `.
  `----._-~.     _\ \ |_       \   / /- _      `.
         ~~----~~  \ \| ~~--~~~(  + /     ~-.     ~- _
                   /  /         \  \          ~- . _ _~_-_.
                __/  /          _\  )
              .<___.'         .<___/
```

## Integers

-   If all we have is 1's and 0's, use base-2
-   9<sub>10</sub> is (1×8)+(0×4)+(0×2)+(1×1) = 1001<sub>2</sub>

---

## Notation

-   Can write numbers in binary using `0b` prefix

```python
print(0b101101)
```
```
45
```

-   Much more common to use **hexadecimal** (base 16)
    -   Digits are 0123456789ABCDEF
    -   Each represents 4 bits (a __nybble__)

```python
print(0x2D)
```
```
45
```

---

## Negative Numbers

-   Could use __sign and magnitude__
    -   `0100` is 4
    -   `1100` is -4
-   But:
    -   Gives us two zeroes (one positive, one negative)
    -   Makes the hardware to do arithmetic more complicated
---

## Negative Numbers

-   Instead, use __two's complement__

| Base 10 | Base 2 |
| ------- | ------ |
| 3       | 011    |
| 2       | 010    |
| 1       | 001    |
| 0       | 000    |
| -1      | 111    |
| -2      | 110    |
| -3      | 101    |
| -4      | 100    |

--

-   Can still determine sign by looking at the first bit
-   But two's complement is asymmetric
    -   Even if `x` is a valid number, `-x` may not be

---

## Bitwise Operations

<table>
<tr><th> Name        </th><th> Expression </th><th> Bitwise       </th><th> Result          </th></tr>
<tr><td> and         </td><td> 12 & 6   </td><td> 1100 & 0110 </td><td> 4 (0100)    </td></tr>
<tr><td> or          </td><td> 12 | 6   </td><td> 1100 | 0110 </td><td> 14 (1110)   </td></tr>
<tr><td> xor         </td><td> 12 ^ 6   </td><td> 1100 ^ 0110 </td><td> 10 (1010)   </td></tr>
<tr><td> not         </td><td> ~ 6      </td><td> ~ 0110      </td><td> 9 (1001)    </td></tr>
<tr><td> left shift  </td><td> 12 << 2  </td><td> 1100 << 2   </td><td> 48 (110000) </td></tr>
<tr><td> right shift </td><td> 12 >> 2  </td><td> 1100 >> 2   </td><td> 3 (0011)    </td></tr>
</table>

-   Use `x | 0b0010` to set the second-to-last bit
-   Use `x & 0b1101` to clear the second-to-last bit
    -   Which is often written `x & ~0b0010` for clarity

---

## Shifting is Not Arithmetic

-   Shifting up and down is *almost* like multiplying or dividing by 2
-   But what if the top bit changes?
-   If we only have 4 bits, `0b1111 >> 1` is `0b0111`, so -1/2 is 7

---

## Text

-   ASCII originally defined 128 7-bit characters
    -   0–31 were **control codes**
-   Since bytes have 8 bits, programmers used the values 128–255 however they wanted
-   ANSI standard defined (for example) 231<sub>10</sub> to be "ç"
-   But what about Turkish? Or Devanagari? Or kanji, or hieroglyphics, or…?
    -   Two bytes wouldn't be enough
    -   Four bytes per character would quadruple storage requirements
    -   And would mostly not be needed (by American businesses)

---

## Unicode

-   Define a **code point** for every character
    -   U+0065 for an upper-case Latin "A"
    -   U+2605 for a black star &#9733;
-   Define several **encodings**
-   UTF-32 uses 32 bits for every character
-   Most popular is **UTF-8**
    -   Code points 0–127 are stored in a single byte with a leading 0
    -   If the top bit is 1, the number of 1's tells UTF-8 how many bytes there are in the character

---

## Unicode

-   If the first byte is `0b11101101`:
    -   The leading 1 means "multibyte"
    -   The next two bytes mean "this is a three-byte character"
    -   The first 0 separates the header from the start of the character
    -   The final `1101` is the first four bits of the character
-   Every **continuation byte** starts with `10`
    -   So we can tell if a byte is in the middle of a character

---

## How to Store a Number

-   C and Fortran store numbers as numbers
-   Python used **boxed values**
    -   Reference count
    -   Type code
    -   Value

## How to Store a Number

-   The differences are even larger for arrays and lists

</figure>

---

## Packing and Unpacking

-   Operations on unboxed (raw) values are much faster
    -   Most numerical and image processing libraries written in C or Fortran
    -   Then wrapped in Python or R
-   Need a way to:
    -   Get data from raw bytes into Python structures
    -   Copy data from Python structures into packed bytes
-   Also do this for efficient storage of large data

---

## The `struct` Module

```python
import struct

fmt = "ii"  # two 32-bit integers
x = 31
y = 65

binary = struct.pack(fmt, x, y)
print("binary representation:", repr(binary))

normal = struct.unpack(fmt, binary)
print("back to normal:", normal)
```
```
binary representation: b'\x1f\x00\x00\x00A\x00\x00\x00'
back to normal: (31, 65)
```

---

## Packing With Counts

```python
from struct import pack

print(pack("3i", 1, 2, 3))
print(pack("5s", bytes("hello", "utf-8")))
print(pack("5s", bytes("a longer string", "utf-8")))
```
```
b'\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00'
b'hello'
b'a lon'
```

-   Only packs as much as we tell it to
-   So construct format dynamically

```python
text = "hello"
print(f"{len(text)}s")
```
```
5s
```

---

## Variable-Length Packing

-   Pack strings of variable length as:
    -   A count (of known size)
    -   That many bytes

```python
from struct import pack

def pack_string(as_string):
    as_bytes = bytes(as_string, "utf-8")
    header = pack("i", len(as_bytes))
    format = f"{len(as_bytes)}s"
    body = pack(format, as_bytes)
    return header + body

result = pack_string("hello! こんにちは!")
print(repr(result))
```
```
b'\x17\x00\x00\x00hello! '
b'\xe3\x81\x93\xe3\x82\x93\xe3\x81\xab\xe3\x81\xa1\xe3\x81\xaf!'
```

---

## Unpacking

```python
from struct import unpack

def unpack_string(buffer):
   header, body = buffer[:4], buffer[4:]
   length = unpack("i", header)[0]
   format = f"{length}s"
   result = unpack(format, body)[0]
   return str(result, "utf-8")

buffer = pack_string("hello! こんにちは!")
result = unpack_string(buffer)
print(result)
```
```
hello
```

---

## Cheating

-   Bytes are just bytes
-   Pack an integer into four 8-bit characters or vice versa

<figure>
  <img src="../binary_packing_unpacking.svg" alt="Packing and unpacking values" width="100%">
  <figcaption>Low-level and high-level array storage.</figcaption>
</figure>

```python
text = "abcd"
temp = struct.pack("4s", bytes(text, "utf-8"))
num = struct.unpack("i", temp)[0]
print(f"result: {num} (0x{num:x})")
```
```
result: 1684234849 (0x64636261)
```

## Binary Mode

-   `open(filename, "r")` converts bytes to characters
    -   And converts Windows line endings `\r\n` to Unix `\n`
-   Use `open(filename, "rb")` to read in **binary mode**

---

## Floating Point Numbers

-   Have a sign, a __mantissa__, and an __exponent__
-   IEEE 754 standard uses 1, 23, and 8 bits respectively
-   We can illustrate the problems with a 5-bit representation

<figure>
  <img src="../binary_floating_point.svg" alt="Representing floating point numbers" width="60%">
  <figcaption>Representing floating point numbers.</figcaption>
</figure>

- IEEE 754 shifts things around to avoid redundancy

---

## Rounding

-   Our scheme has no way to represent 9
    -   So 8+1 is either 8 or 10
    -   Do we calculate 8+1+1 as (8+1)+1 or as 8+(1+1)?
-   Authors of numerical libraries spend a lot of time worrying about this
-   We're not going to, but:
    1.  Never use `==` when comparing floating-point numbers
    2.  Use __relative error__ rather than __absolute error__ in tests

## File Types

The first eight bytes of a PNG image file always contain the following (base-10) values:

```
137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10
```

Write a program that determines whether a file is a PNG image or not.

## Converting Integers to Bits

Using Python's bitwise operators,
write a function that returns the binary representation of a non-negative integer.
Write another function that converts a string of 1's and 0's into an integer
(treating it as unsigned).
