title: "A Testing Framework"
template: slides
---

## Background

-   Different kinds of programs need different kinds of tests
    -   One-off data analysis script: check each step by eye
    -   [SQLite][sqlite]: 98% of the code is there to test the other 2%
-   Good tools make good tests easier to write
-   So this lesson build a unit testing framework like [pytest][pytest]

---

## The Big Idea

<p class="shout">A program is just another data structure.</p>

## Functions are Objects

-   `def` defines a variable that refers to the function's instructions
-   We can assign that value to another variable as usual

```python
def example():
    print("in example")

alias = example
alias()
```
```
in example
```

---

## Functions in Lists

-   We can put functions in lists

```python
def first():
    print("First")

def second():
    print("Second")

def third():
    print("Third")

everything = [first, second, third]
for func in everything:
    func()
```
```
First
Second
Third
```

-   For this to work, we have to know how to call the functions

---

## A Function and Some Tests

```python
def sign(value):
    if value < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1

def test_sign_negative():
    assert sign(-3) == -1

def test_sign_positive():
    assert sign(19) == 1

def test_sign_zero():
    assert sign(0) == 0

def test_sign_error():
    assert sgn(1) == 1
```

---

## Running Tests

-   Apply the function to a __fixture__
-   Compare the __actual result__ to the __expected result__
-   Each outcome is __pass__, __fail__, or __error__

```python
def run_tests(all_tests):
    results = {"pass": 0, "fail": 0, "error": 0}
    for test in all_tests:
        try:
            test()
            results["pass"] += 1
        except AssertionError:
            results["fail"] += 1
        except Exception:
            results["error"] += 1
    print(f"pass {results['pass']}")
    print(f"fail {results['fail']}")
    print(f"error {results['error']}")
```

---

## Running Tests

```python
TESTS = [
    test_sign_negative,
    test_sign_positive,
    test_sign_zero,
    test_sign_error
]

run_tests(TESTS)
```
```
pass 2
fail 1
error 1
```

-   Each test is run exactly the same way
-   Easy to create new tests
-   …so long as we remember to add the test function to `TESTS`

---

## How Python Stores Variables

-   Python stores variables in (something very much like) a dictionary

```python
globals()
```
```
{
    '__name__': '__main__',
    '__doc__': None,
    '__package__': None,
    '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>,
    '__spec__': None,
    '__annotations__': {},
    '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>
}
```

---

## Further Proof

```python
my_variable = 123
globals()
```
```
{
    '__name__': '__main__',
    '__doc__': None,
    '__package__': None,
    '__loader__': <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>,
    '__spec__': None,
    '__annotations__': {},
    '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>,
*   'my_variable': 123
}
```

--

-   Note: the function `locals` gives local variables

---

## Introspection

-   We know how to loop over a dictionary's keys

```python
def find_tests(prefix):
    for (name, func) in globals().items():
        if name.startswith(prefix):
            print(name, func)

find_tests("test_")
```
```
test_sign_negative <function test_sign_negative at 0x10cad39d0>
test_sign_positive <function test_sign_positive at 0x10cad3e50>
test_sign_zero <function test_sign_zero at 0x10cad3ee0>
test_sign_error <function test_sign_error at 0x10cad3f70>
```

--

- Note: when we print a function, Python shows its name and location in memory

---

## Objects Have Attributes

-   The function `dir` returns a list of an object's attributes

```python
def example():
    "Docstring for example."
    print("in example")

print(dir(example))
```
```
['__annotations__', '__call__', '__class__', '__closure__', \
 '__code__', `__defaults__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', \
 '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__get__', …
]
```

-   `__name__`: the function's original name
-   `__doc__`: its __docstring__

---

## Classifying Test Functions

```python
def test_sign_negative():
    assert sign(-3) == -1
*test_sign_negative.skip = True

def test_sign_positive():
    assert sign(19) == 1

def test_sign_zero():
    assert sign(0) == 0
*test_sign_zero.fail = True

def test_sign_error():
    assert sgn(1) == 1

def classify(func):
    if hasattr(func, "skip") and func.skip:
        return "skip"
    if hasattr(func, "fail") and func.fail:
        return "fail"
    return "run"
```

---

## A Better (?) Test Runner

```python
def run_tests(prefix):
    all_names = [n for n in globals() if n.startswith(prefix)]
    for name in all_names:
        func = globals()[name]
        kind = classify(func)
        try:
            if kind == "skip":
                print(f"skip: {name}")
            else:
                func()
                print(f"pass: {name}")
        except AssertionError as e:
            if kind == "fail":
                print(f"pass (expected failure): {name}")
            else:
                print(f"fail: {name} {str(e)}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"error: {name} {str(e)}")
```

---

## A Better (?) Test Runner

```python
run_tests("test_")
```
```
skip: test_sign_negative
pass: test_sign_positive
pass (expected failure): test_sign_zero
error: test_sign_error name 'sgn' is not defined
```

-   Why the question mark?

--

1.  Adding attributes to functions is clumsy and unusual
    -   Most libraries use __decorators__
2.  This version prints results instead of returning a data structure
    -   What if we want to compare with previous results?
    -   Or convert to HTML, or…?

---

## Finding Test Files

-   Test runner should find files containing tests
    -   Typing names each time is as error-prone as typing names of test functions
-   Use the `glob` module

```python
import glob

for name in glob.glob("**/*.txt", root_dir=".", recursive=True):
    print(name)
```

--

-   Name comes from an old Unix command that did global matching
    -   Needed so often that it was quickly built into the shell

## Magic

-   [Clarke's Third Law][clarkes_laws]:
    any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
-   Also true of technologies we encounter
    before we have the background knowledge they depend on
-   How we import a module will seem reasonable once we know more
-   Until then we copy, paste, and move on
-   Even the most experienced programmers do this in a new domain
    -   It's easier to learn things once we have more context
    -  Setting a problem aside and returning to it later can save a lot of time

---

## Test Case

```python
# sample_dir/test_up.py

title = "testing example"

def test_succeeds():
    assert True

def test_fails():
    assert False
```

--

```shell
python import_example.py sample_dir/test_up.py title
```
```
After all that, the value is 'testing example'
```

---

## Loading Files as Modules

```python
import importlib.util
import sys

path = sys.argv[1]
variable = sys.argv[2]

spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("", path)
module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(module)
value = getattr(module, variable)
print(f"After all that, the value is '{value}'")
```

1.  Build a specification of what we're going to import
2.  Build a Python module in memory from that spec
3.  Execute the code in the module
4.  Use `getattr` because modules aren't dictionaries

## Looping Over `globals`

What happens if you run:

```python
for name in globals():
    print(name)
```

What happens if you run:

```python
name = None
for name in globals():
    print(name)
```

Why?

## Counting Results

1.  Modify the test framework so that it reports which tests passed, failed, or had errors
    and also reports a summary of how many tests produced each result.

2.  Write unit tests to check that your answer to part 1 works correctly.

3.  Think of another plausible way to interpret part 1
    that *wouldn't* pass the tests you wrote for part 2.

## Failing on Purpose

Putting assertions into code to check that it is behaving correctly
is called __defensive programming__.
It's a good practice,
but we should make sure those assertions are failing when they're supposed to,
just as we should test our smoke detectors every once in a while.

Modify the tester so that
if a test function's docstring is `"test:assert"`,
the test passes if it raises an `AssertionError`
and fails if it does not.
Tests whose docstring don't contain `"test:assert"`
should behave as before.

## Setup and Teardown

Testing frameworks often allow programmers to specify a `setup` function
that is to be run before each test
and a corresponding `teardown` function
that is to be run after each test.
(`setup` usually re-creates complicated test fixtures,
while `teardown` functions are sometimes needed to clean up after tests,
e.g., to close database connections or delete temporary files.)

Modify the testing tool in this chapter so that
if a file of tests contains a function called `setup`
then the tool calls it exactly once before running each test in the file.
Add a similar way to register a `teardown` function.
