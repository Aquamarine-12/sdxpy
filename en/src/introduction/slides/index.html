## Background

-   The best way to learn design is to study examples
-   [Oram2007]: favorite piece of code
-   [Brown2011, Brown2012]: describe real open source applications
    -   Too big and too scattered
-   [Brown2016] used small working models instead
    -   Too many languages
    -   Most application domains unfamiliar to most readers
-   [Wilson2022] tried to fix both problems
    -   One language (JavaScript)
    -   Familiar problems: the tools programmers use every day

---

## This Material

-   Python 3
-   (Mostly) command-line applications
    -   All less than 200 lines long
-   Things programmer (should) use every day

      <strong>Maya</strong> learned Python as an undergrad in biology.
      She can create multi-page scripts and notebooks for herself
      but wants to learn how to build software other people can use.
      This material will fill in some gaps in her programming knowledge
      and teach her some common design patterns.

      <strong>Rupinder</strong> is a computer science undergrad.
      He has learned a lot of theory,
      and uses Git and unit testing tools in assignments,
      but doesn't understand how they work.
      This material will help him understand how software tools work
      and show him how to design new ones.

      <strong>Yim</strong> teaches a college course on software architecture.
      They and their students are frustrated that textbooks are so abstract
      and don't use examples they can relate to.
      This material will give Yim and their students
      starting points for a wide variety of course assignments.

## You Should Know How Toâ€¦

-   Use dictionaries, exceptions, and classes
    -   If you can use these,
        we assume you can use lists, loops, conditionals, and functions
-   Write an HTML page
-   Run commands with the Unix shell
-   Use basic Git commands
    -   `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
-   Process nested lists recursively
    -   This is the most complicated thing we *don't* explain

## Pedagogical Notes

1.  Diagrams help (most) people learn [Wilson2019]
    -   But take time to create and are a pain to maintain
    -   So these slides are mostly text for now
1.  We will mix slides and live coding
    -   I will use a simple editor and a Unix shell
        to avoid screen clutter
    -   Please follow along in the tools of your choice
1.  You can download the example code from [the book's website][sdxpy_site]
    and use it as a starting point for exercises
