## Background

> We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.
> <br>
> — Marshall McLuhan

-   The best way to learn design is to study examples
-   [Brown2011, Brown2102] dissected real open source applications
    -   Too big and too scattered
-   [Brown2016] used small working models instead
    -   Too many languages
    -   Most application domains unfamiliar to most readers
-   [Wilson2022] tried to fix both problems
    -   One language: JavaScript
    -   Familiar problems: the tools programmers use every day

      <strong>Aïsha</strong> learned Python as an undergrad in biology.
      She can create multi-page scripts and notebooks for herself
      but wants to learn how to build software other people can use.

      <strong>Rupinder</strong> is a computer science undergrad.
      He has learned a lot of theory,
      and uses Git and unit testing tools in assignments,
      but doesn't understand how they work.

      <strong>Yim</strong> teaches a college course on software architecture.
      They and their students are frustrated that textbooks are so abstract
      and don't use examples they can relate to.

## You Should Already Know…

-   How to use dictionaries, exceptions, and classes.
    -   We assume that if you can use these,
        you can also use lists, loops, conditionals, and functions.
-   Create static web pages using HTML and CSS.
-   Use Git to save and share files.
    -   It's OK not to know the more obscure commands.
-   Process nested lists recursively.
    -   This is the most complicated thing we *don't* explain.

## Pedagogical Notes

1.  Diagrams help (most) people learn [Wilson2019]
    -   But take time to create and are a pain to maintain
    -   So these slides are mostly text for now
1.  We will be live coding during lessons
    -   I will use a simple text editor and a Unix shell
        to avoid screen clutter
    -   Please follow along in the IDE of your choice
1.  You can download the source code for all the examples from [the book's website][sdxpy_site]
    and use it as a starting point for exercises
