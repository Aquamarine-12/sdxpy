title: "Conclusion"

We have come a long way since we first looked in `globals()` in [%x tester %].
Hashing files,
matching regular expressions,
looking up functions on the fly:
programmers do these things every day,
and we hope that understanding how they work
will help you use them more effectively.

We also hope that your journey won't stop here.
If you would like to add a chapter to this book
or translate it into another language,
your help would be very welcome:
please see [%x introduction %] and [%x contributing %] for more information.
